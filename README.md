Demos using [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) in ES6 JavaScript

* [currency-converter](./currency-converter) is a couple of simple demos of interactive forms in Mithril
* [hello-increasing-abstraction](./hello-increasing-abstraction) is a series of fourteen examples demonstrating moving from displaying plain HTML for content towards finally using specification-driven components for editing content initially requested over the network

Vendor (third-party):

* Mithril (MIT license) used in all demos

These examples were originally written for Maquette vdom and then converted over to Mithril.
